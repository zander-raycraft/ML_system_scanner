# ML_system_scanner
This project is a cybersecurity-focused system scanner that uses machine learning (ML) to monitor, analyze, and detect anomalies in real-time system processes. It combines the power of system-level monitoring with anomaly detection algorithms to identify suspicious activities and respond dynamically.
