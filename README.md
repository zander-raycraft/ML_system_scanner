# 🚨System Scanner for Anomoly Detection 🕵️‍♂️
This project is a cybersecurity-focused system scanner that uses machine learning (ML) to monitor, analyze, and detect anomalies in real-time system processes. It combines the power of system-level monitoring with anomaly detection algorithms to identify suspicious activities and respond dynamically.

## Features

- **📊 Process Monitoring**: Metrics:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory consumption
  - Disk I/O
  - Network activity

- **🤖 ML Integration**:
  - **Supervised Learning**: Classifies processes as normal or anomaly using Random Forest algo.
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Detects unknown threats through Isolation Forest algo.

- **🔐 Cybersecurity Defenses**:
  - Logs suspicious processes with insight.
  - Flags or terminates anomolies preventing potential attacks.

- **📈 Visualization**:
  - Report generation (.CSV) to analyze flagged processes.
  - System behavior monitoring.
